            <p>Throughout this course, I’ve focused on my passion for medical technology and the potential socio-economic impacts that advanced medical innovations can have. While I’m deeply passionate about the medical field, I also recognize the significant challenges it faces, many of which I’m eager to help address. For this project, I’ve chosen to develop a machine learning model aimed at predicting the future of healthcare affordability. However, to build a robust and accurate model, reliable data must be available, which presents limitations on the model’s effectiveness.</p>
